**Starting Questions**
- [ ] This is a mod incompatibility, if I use this in vanilla Forge, with only Et Futurum Requiem installed it works as I'd expect it to.

_Please specify the actual version... please don't just say "latest", tell me the version number of the mod in-game, or the name the jar had when downloading it._
Version:
If this is a crash, please upload the report:


**Describe the bug**
_A clear and concise description of what the bug is._

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Wax a copper block of any kind
2. Using any compatible axe item, right click to scrape it off
3. The game crashes

**Mod Incompatibilities**
_If this was a mod incompatibility, what are the possible suspects? If you're not 100% sure, you can still list your suspected mods here, just tell me if you're not certain they actually cause it._

**Mod List**
_If you have posted a crash report above or this is not a mod incompatibility, you can skip this. If you're filling this out because of a mod incompatibility that isn't a crash, crash reports generate a mods list you can copy. Please use Pastebin if it is large. If you don't have an up-to-date crash report, you can hold F3 + C for 10 seconds while in a world to crash the game, which will give you a crash report._

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Additional context**
Any other info I may have missed. If you know the code which causes the error please post a link to it.
