WARNING!

Though this project is licensed under the Public Domain a lot of the code featured here is a direct copy or adaptation of Mojangs original code. So be careful with what you do with it.

This project is jss2a98aj's fork of KryptonCaptain's Et Futurum build, as well as a merge of Roadhog360's changes he made to Et Futurum and never published anywhere. Makamys is a great help with helping me get the concept of Mixin code and various incredibly useful commits.

## Contributing

Mixin code will not work if you do not add `--tweakClass org.spongepowered.asm.launch.MixinTweaker --mixin mixins.etfuturum.json` to your program arguments.

To enable incomplete test features, add `-Detfuturum.testing=true` to your JVM arguments.
