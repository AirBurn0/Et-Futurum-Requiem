 * Allows blocks/items to run specific code during load phases, without having to manually add them there. Only runs if the content is enabled.
 * The funcs are not abstract by default since most things will only use one so it's better to just pull in the func needed.
 * This avoids spamming a class that implements it with 3 empty functions.
