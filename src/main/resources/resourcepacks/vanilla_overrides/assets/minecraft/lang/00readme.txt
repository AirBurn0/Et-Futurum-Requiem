So, why does this file exist here instead of in the main assets at etfuturum/lang directory?
These are for overriding vanilla lang key names + some new lang keys for vanilla items that did not get them.
This is so we can allow the user to toggle lang keys that change the name of vanilla items and blocks, under the option "enableLangReplacements" in the config.
